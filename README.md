# MIE429 Capstone Project

## Installation/Development
We provide an `environment.yml` file to define python/package versions.

To set up a conda environment in `./env` using this yaml file:
```
conda env create --prefix env -f environment.yml
```

Then you can activate it with:
```
conda activate ./env
```

For more information about maintaining the `environment.yml` file please check
[the official conda reference](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).
